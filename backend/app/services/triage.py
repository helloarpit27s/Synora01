"""Deterministic triage scoring plus a grounded, non-diagnostic explanation.

The model never decides the band. `score_triage()` is a pure function: same
input, same output, forever. The reasoning model receives a band that has
already been decided and rewrites it. When the band is `immediate` there is no
model call at all — an emergency is the wrong moment for a network round-trip.
